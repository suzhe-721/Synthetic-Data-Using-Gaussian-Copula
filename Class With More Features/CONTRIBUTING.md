# Contributing to GaussianCopulaSynthesizer

I warmly welcome contributions to the GaussianCopulaSynthesizer project. If you're looking to help, this document will guide you through the process.

## Ways to Contribute

There are several ways you can contribute to this project:

1. **Code Contributions:**
   If you're a developer, you can help by addressing open issues or improving the existing codebase. Specifically, we're looking for help in the following areas:
   - **Optimizing Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Computations:** The current implementation, while effective in capturing column distributions, suffers from long computation times. Any improvements in this area would be highly beneficial.
   - **Enhancing Inverse Transformation Method:** I use the `brentq` method for inverse transformations from standard normal Gaussian to synthetic data. However, this sometimes leads to errors. I am looking for more reliable or efficient approaches.
2. **Documentation:**
   Improving or expanding the project documentation is another valuable way of contributing. This includes writing clearer instructions, providing additional examples, or creating tutorials.
